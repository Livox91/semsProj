## Folder Structure

The project directory is structured to enhance clarity and maintainability, following Angular best practices.

- **src:** Contains all the files related to the main application.

- **app:** Serves as the main component of the Angular application, housing child components and managing the overall structure.

- **core:** Contains essential components crucial for the application's functionality. This includes a component responsible for storing product data fetched from the server.

- **features:** Contains independent components such as `Main`, `About`, and `Products`. These components operate autonomously, contributing to the modularity and scalability of the application.

- **shared:** Includes components shared across the application, promoting consistency in design and user experience. Notable components in this directory are `Header` and `Footer`, as they are fundamental elements present on every page of the application.
